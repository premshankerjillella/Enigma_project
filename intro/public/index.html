<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="4" align="center">According to the indepedent CSR jouranl,INDIANS waste as much food as the whole of United Kingdom consumes – 
a statistic that may not so much indicative of our love of surfeit, as it is of our population. 
Still, food wastage is an alarming issue in India. Our street and garbage bins, landfills have sufficient proof to prove it.</p>
<p>Weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, households spew out so much food.  
According to the United Nations Development Programme, up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted. 
About 21 million tonnes of wheat are wasted in India and 50% of all food across the world meets the same fate and never reaches the needy. 
In fact, according to the agriculture ministry, Rs. 50,000 crore worth of food produced is wasted every year in the country!</p>
<p align="center">Even though the world produces enough food to feed twice the world’s present population, 
 food wastage is ironically behind the billions of people who are malnourished. 
 <b>The number of hungry people in India has increased by 65 million more than the population of France.</b>
 According to a survey by Bhook (an organization working towards reducing hunger) in 2013, 20 crore Indians sleep hungry on any given night. 
 <b>About 7 million children died in 2012 because of hunger/malnutrition.</b></p></font>
